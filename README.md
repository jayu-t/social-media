## Welcome to MY Project 'Social-Media'

In this project i trying to create a social media like facebook and whats app. I'M working on this project more than 40 days. Basically i start this project for testing my problem solving approch.

In developement period i get lot of error. Sometime feels very happy sometimes feel very angry when trying to solve these error. 

But i love error. Because when error comes i understand what is actual problem and 60 to 80% erros solve in some time. 
But when wrong output comes and i to debug a code. Sometime it solve in very less time time but sometime it takes lot of time.
Here my observation is error is better than wrong output.
